## About

This is a template project that provides a basic project set-up for working with LitElement (using TypeScript) and webpack. I have created this project mainly for myself to save time getting a new project spun up but happy for anyone to use.

The structure is focussed on developing an application rather than a single web component and provides two sample web components. 

Currently uses:
* LitElement 2.0.1
* TypeScript 3.3.3
* webpack 4.29.6

## How to use the template

Up front, the project structure is  not meant to be prescriptive but purely a starting point. Feel free to adapt and change as suits you.

Once you have cloned or copied the project run from the command line ```npm install``` and then ```npm run dev``` to verify that it is all working,
