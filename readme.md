## About

This is a template project that provides a basic project set-up for working with LitElement (using TypeScript) and webpack. I have created this project mainly for myself to save time getting a new project spun up but happy for anyone to use.

The structure is focussed on developing an application rather than a single web component but should be easy enough to adapt for single component development. Two simple components have been included just to prove it works.

Key libraries used are:
* LitElement 2.0.1
* TypeScript 3.3.3
* webpack 4.29.6
* @open-wc/demoing-storybook: 0.2.2 

## How to use the template

Up front, the project structure is  not meant to be prescriptive but purely a starting point. Feel free to adapt and change as suits you.

Once you have cloned or copied the project run from the command line ```npm install``` and then ```npm run dev``` to verify that it is all working. If you have cloned the project run ```git remote rm destination``` to remove the remote destination.

I have also included the open-wc implementation of Storybook to provide a design system. For more information on open-wc and Storybook see the links in references.
